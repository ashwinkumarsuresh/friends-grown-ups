2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy your API key (starts with `AIza`)

#### Option B: Anthropic Claude

2. Sign up or log in
3. Click "API Keys" in the left sidebar
4. Click "Create Key"

### Step 2: Run the Game

**IMPORTANT**: You MUST run the game through the proxy server. Simply opening the HTML file won't work due to browser security (CORS).

#### Run the Python Proxy Server

```bash
# Navigate to the game folder
cd /Users/ashwin/Documents/Code/Game/friends-grown-ups/

# Run the proxy server (Python 3)
python3 proxy-server.py
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3002`

#### Optional: Configure AI Models

Create a `.env` file in the game directory to customize which AI models to use:

```bash
# .env file
GOOGLE_MODEL=gemini-2.0-flash
ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-20250514
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

To use environment variables, install python-dotenv:
```bash
pip3 install python-dotenv
```

### Step 3: Play the Game

1. **Open your browser** and go to: `http://localhost:3002`

2. **Add Friends**:
   - Enter each friend's name
   - Click "Add Friend"
   - Add at least 2 friends to start

3. **Select AI Provider**:
   - Choose Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, or OpenAI GPT
   - Enter your API key

4. **Start Playing**:
   - Click "Start Game!"
   - Watch the exciting spinner select a random friend
   - Adjust the spice level to your group's comfort
   - Choose from 3 AI-generated topics
   - Answer the question (discussion happens in person)
   - Click "Next Round" to continue or "End Game" to stop
